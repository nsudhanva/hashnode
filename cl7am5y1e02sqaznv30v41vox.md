## Resume Tips That Will Help You Land Your Software Engineering Job

Before we get started, we want to make it clear that everything we cover in this document is just a guideline. There's no exact science when it comes down to what a company is looking for in a resume.

Writing Résumé/CV is a key task in helping you find a job. Think of 'résumé' in the perspective of a recruiter/company. They get hundreds of job applications everyday and barely have time to go through them all. Your résumé should provide them the exact information they need.  It's all the more important that you put your best foot forward with that resume, and this document will help to keep things simple.

> Don't be a prisoner of your résumé. You wrote it to describe your past, not your future

Clarity
-------

*   The person reviewing your resume should be able to find pertinent information easily and quickly.
*   **PDF formatting** is always preferred. The format should be clean, simple and consistent.
*   You can save your Word/docx format as PDF from the options menu
*   Black text is always a safe bet. Keep consistent font and size.
*   Try to use bullet points whenever possible.
*   Use only plain text as it will be easy for [Application Tracking Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) to interpret.

Content
-------

*   Focus on results and impact. List metrics and examples concisely rather than writing overly long descriptions.
*   Be sure to include your contact information and email address as well.
*   It is important to list your LinkedIn, Github or Personal Portfolio profile at the top of your resume.
*   Try to keep your resume to one to two pages, including relevant information only.

Formula
-------

*   Be concise and don't be afraid to brag. This is your time to show off.
*   Follow the formula: `Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z` for crafting bullets in your resume.
*   For example, "I increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring our API" or "Won second place out of 50  
    teams at a hackathon" clarifies just how impressive the win actually was

Dont's
------

*   **Do not** write objectives or goals.
*   **Do not** include your profile picture or gender.
*   **Do not** write your home address or your personal family details.
*   **Do not** include your 10th or 12th grade or anything prior to your degree.
*   **Do not** make typos or have unfinished sentences. Use a tool like [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) to help yourself out.
*   **Do not** include your achievements from high school or anything prior to your degree.
*   **Do not** include your work experience that is not related to engineering.
*   **Do not** use fancy colors, graffitis or abstract colors. Eg: **Do not** use tools like Novoresume
*   **Do not** use the default format provided by MS Word or Google Docs.

Format
------

*   Education should always be listed first under your contact information.
*   Work experience includes internships or jobs and any other experience.
*   You can list personal projects, academy projects or class projects.
*   You can list awards or a leadership experience.
*   And don't forget extracurriculars. The companies want to learn more about you.

Education
---------

*   Your education should be front and centre. Please include your degree and major, and definitely make sure you include your graduation date.
*   Also include your grade point average and don't be scared by this.
*   Although GPA is a factor, they look at the whole package and understand that every college and student is different.

Experience
----------

*   List your experiences in **reverse chronological order**, starting with your most recent experience.
*   You can include your experience at academy/intern as `Full Stack Web Developement Trianee at <that academy>`
*   Always include the **employer, position, and dates** that you are employed.
*   Keep descriptions concise and clear. You can use the format suggested by Google recruiters: `Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z`. Make sure you highlight your accomplishments.
*   Showcase results for internships, jobs, academic research, teaching, hackathons or coding competitions and tutoring experience.
*   You can also include experience from student groups, selected personal and class projects.

Projects
--------

*   Spend more time on this section especially if you don't have much work experience.
*   It is important to list your **GitHub** profile at the top of your resume and to include your programming languages.
*   GitHub or other prominent open-source work shows us that you're contributing to the open-source community and that you're passionate about the work that you're doing and looking to improve your skills.
*   They also look at the **programming languages** you are using. Also make sure you're comfortable interviewing in the languages you listed and include any language you use in any specific project descriptions on your resume.
*   **Include the languages or frameworks used next to your projects**. Also make sure to show your impact.
*   Use **action-oriented** language as well. Words like debug, created, and designed are great. **Here's a hint: read the job description and look at the language that it uses. Write the resume for the job description.**
*   Use data and examples as well as things like `"adding new feature, algorithmic improvements, caching data on local storage, implemented data analytics".` Use comparisons and averages to provide context as well.

Extra
-----

*   They also love hearing about **extracurriculars and what makes you, you outside of the classroom.**
*   Be sure to include things like these: student groups, leadership, position, university honors, awards or scholarships, publications, papers or patents you've worked on, conference presentations and any impressive  
    achievements or activities in other areas.
