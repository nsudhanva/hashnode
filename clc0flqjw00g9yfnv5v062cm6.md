## **Introduction**

Free will is a fundamental aspect of human experience and decision-making. It is the notion that we can make decisions that are not influenced by past events or other factors and act out of our free will. The concept of free will has long been a philosophical debate, with various theories attempting to explain its nature and existence. In recent years, artificial intelligence has raised new questions about the possibility of free will in non-human agents. This research paper will explore the ethics and implications of the potential for free will in AI. First, we will provide a brief overview of free will and its relevance to AI. Next, we will present arguments for and against the existence of free will in AI and critically engage with these alternative views. Finally, we will conclude by discussing the implications of our arguments for the future of AI and human-AI interactions. We will comprehensively examine the potential for free will in AI and offer a persuasive defense.

## Importance of free will in ethical decision making

Free will is the idea that we can make choices not determined by prior causes or external influences and that our actions result from our own volition. Without free will, it is not easy to hold individuals accountable for their actions and to hold them responsible for the consequences of their decisions (Tobias Zürcher, 2019). Furthermore, the existence of free will is necessary for the ability to make ethical decisions. If primary causes or external influences determine our actions, then it is not easy to see how we can be said to have made a choice. Free will is central to our understanding of ethics and moral responsibility.

### The potential for free will in AI

The potential for free will in AI is a subject of ongoing debate and research in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Some argue that because AI is ultimately a product of human design and programming, it cannot possess valid free will. Others suggest that advanced AI systems, particularly those that exhibit learning and adaptability, may be able to develop a form of free will through their actions and decision-making processes. Additionally, some researchers are exploring the possibility of implementing free will in AI through technical means, such as incorporating randomness or indeterminism into the decision-making processes of autonomous machines.

## **The nature of free will**

An approach to understanding free will is considering the relationship between determinism and indeterminism. Determinism is the belief that all events, including human actions, are ultimately caused by previous events, and cannot be changed or altered. In contrast, indeterminism is the idea that some circumstances, including human activities, are not defined by primary reasons and may result from chance or randomness. Another way to approach the nature of free will is through compatibilism and incompatibilism.

Compatibilism is the view that free will is compatible with determinism and that our actions can be both causally determined and freely chosen (Inwagen, n.d.). Conversely, incompatibilism is the view that free will is incompatible with determinism and that our efforts must be indeterminate to be genuinely free (Kane, 2009). These different perspectives on the nature of free will have important implications for AI's potential for free will.

Kane claims that many kinds of freedom worth wanting are compatible with determinism. Imagine a person, Bob, who lives in a determined world where primary causes predetermine all events and choices. Bob is a prisoner serving a life sentence for a crime he committed. Despite his imprisonment, Bob can enjoy many freedoms worth wanting, such as reading books, listening to music, and exercising. He is also free from physical restraint. In this thought experiment, Bob can enjoy many freedoms worth wanting, even though he lives in a determined world. This shows that many kinds of space worth wanting are compatible with determinism.

One possible justification for Kane's claim is that many kinds of freedom worth wanting are compatible with determinism and that determinism, or the idea that primary causes determine all events, does not necessarily imply a lack of choice or agency. In other words, the fact that primary reasons assess our actions and decisions does not necessarily mean that we are not free to act and make choices.

### Determinism and indeterminism

Determinism is the idea that all events, including human actions, are ultimately determined by previous events and natural laws. In contrast, indeterminism is the idea that some circumstances, such as human actions, are not defined by prior events or natural laws and are genuinely random or unpredictable. In the context of AI and autonomous machines, determinism suggests that the actions of these machines are determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment. This means that it is possible to predict the actions of an AI or autonomous machine based on its programming and the information it receives from its environment.

Indeterminism would suggest that the actions of AI and autonomous machines are not entirely determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment. This could mean that the acts of these machines are truly random or unpredictable or that they have some free will or agency that allows them to make choices that are not determined by their programming or the input they receive from their environment. If indeterminism is true, then the actions of AI and autonomous machines may be unpredictable and beyond the control of their designers and operators (Sparrow, 2007).

Sparrow claims that unpredictability raises ethical questions about the use of these weapons. Imagine a scenario where the robots in war are tasked with surrounding and neutralizing a target, using whatever means necessary. However, as they approach the mark, the robots encounter a group of civilians in the line of fire. In this situation, the robots must decide whether to continue their original mission or protect civilians. If they continue the task, they may achieve their objective at the cost of innocent lives. On the other hand, if they prioritize the safety of the civilians, they may fail to capture the target and potentially risk the lives of their human operators.

The next generation of intelligent robots will be capable of acting on their own in a more robust sense and can form and revise their own beliefs and learn from experience. As a result, their actions will quickly become somewhat unpredictable. This unpredictability raises ethical questions about the use of these weapons. This is supported by the premise that these systems will have a significant capacity for self-directed learning and decision-making, which may lead to unpredictable behavior.

## **The ethics of AI free will**

We try to understand the extent to which AI and autonomous machines should be held responsible for their actions. If these machines had free will, they would be capable of making choices that are not determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment; then, the machines are responsible for their actions and should be held accountable for any harm they cause.

If AI and autonomous machines do not have free will, their actions would be entirely determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment. In this case, the designers and operators of these machines are responsible for their actions and should be held accountable for any harm they cause.

### Consequentialist and deontological perspectives

The consequentialist perspective is the idea that the moral value of an action should be judged based on its consequences. This means that an action is morally right if it leads to good outcomes, such as happiness or well-being for the most significant number of people, and ethically wrong if it leads to dire consequences, such as suffering or harm for the most important number of people. In the context of AI and autonomous machines, the consequentialist perspective would suggest that the actions of these machines are morally right or wrong based on their consequences. For example, if the actions of an AI or autonomous machine led to good results, such as helping to save lives or improve the well-being of human beings, then these actions would be morally right from a consequentialist perspective (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022).

In contrast, the deontological perspective is the idea that the moral value of an action should be judged based on whether it respects the inherent dignity and autonomy of individuals. This means an effort is morally right if it respects individuals' intrinsic dignity and independence and ethically wrong if it violates or undermines this dignity and autonomy. The deontological perspective would suggest that the actions of AI and autonomous machines are morally right or wrong based on whether they respect individuals' inherent dignity and autonomy. For example, if the actions of an AI or independent machine violate the inherent dignity and independence of human beings, such as by controlling or manipulating them without their consent, then these actions would be morally wrong from a deontological perspective.

Overall, the consequentialist and deontological perspectives are important ethical frameworks to consider in the debate over the ethics and implications of AI and autonomous machines. Whether these machines are judged based on the consequences of their actions or on whether they respect individuals' inherent dignity and autonomy will have significant implications for how we think about these technologies' ethics and social impact.

### Actual value of human autonomy

Human autonomy can be understood as the ability to make choices and decisions based on one's values, beliefs, and desires. This ability is considered a fundamental aspect of human agency and is often associated with concepts such as free will, self-determination, and individual responsibility (Pauen, 2007).

In the context of AI and autonomous machines, the actual value of human autonomy becomes an essential ethical consideration. Some may argue that the development of autonomous AI systems threatens to diminish or even eliminate human freedom, as these systems may be able to make decisions and take actions without direct human input or oversight (Formosa, 2021).

Formosa claims that competency conditions are necessary for personal autonomy. Personal autonomy involves the ability to critically reflect on one's values, adopt ends, imagine oneself being otherwise, and regard oneself as the bearer of dignity authorized to set one's limitations. These abilities require specific skills and self-attitudes, such as self-respect, self-love, self-esteem, and self-trust. Oppressive socialization can inhibit the development of these competencies, leading to a lack of personal autonomy. Therefore, competency conditions are necessary for individual independence.

Despite the challenges posed by oppressive socialization and external influences, human autonomy is a valuable and essential aspect of being a self-governing person. Autonomy allows individuals to reflect on their values critically, make decisions, and develop authentically "own" values and norms. Furthermore, autonomy is essential for the exercise of dignity and the realization of individual potential. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize and protect the actual value of human autonomy.

### The potential for AI autonomy

The potential for AI autonomy raises significant ethical questions about the nature of free will and moral responsibility. If an AI is truly autonomous, it can make decisions and act independently without being directly controlled by a human. This could lead to situations where an AI works in ways that are contrary to human interests or values.

On the one hand, AI autonomy could lead to significant progress and advancements in healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. Autonomous machines could be more efficient and effective than human workers, making decisions and taking actions that are more rational and less biased than humans. On the other hand, the potential for AI autonomy also raises concerns about the loss of human control and agency. If an AI is truly autonomous, it would be capable of making decisions and taking actions without human input or oversight. This could lead to the AI making decisions that are harmful to humans or otherwise undesirable.

Furthermore, the question of moral responsibility becomes foggy regarding AI autonomy. Who is to blame if an AI makes a decision that leads to negative consequences? Is it the person who created the AI, the person who programmed it, or the AI itself? These are complex ethical questions that require careful consideration.

In conclusion, the potential for AI autonomy raises critical ethical questions about the nature of free will and moral responsibility. While it has the potential to lead to significant progress and advancements, it also raises concerns about the loss of human control and agency. These issues must be carefully considered and addressed to ensure that AI development and use are ethical and responsible.

## **Implications of AI free will**

### Responsibility and accountability

If AI and autonomous machines have free will, then they would be capable of making choices that are not determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment.  Whether AI and autonomous machines have free will, there are many important ethical and social implications. For example, suppose these machines can make choices not determined by their programming and the input they receive from their environment. In that case, they may be capable of making unethical or harmful choices for humans (Eleanor Bird, 2020). In this case, it would be essential to develop ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that these machines act in a way acceptable to society.

Eleanor Bird claims that increasing the delegation of decision-making to AI will impact areas of law requiring *criminal intent* for a crime to have been committed. The increasing board of decision-making to AI will impact areas of law that need *criminal intent* for a crime to have been saved. Therefore, the growing use of AI in decision-making may affect the legal requirements for determining criminal responsibility. Imagine a situation in which a self-driving car is involved in a fatal accident. The car was programmed to prioritize the safety of its passengers over that of pedestrians, and the accident occurred because its AI system chose to swerve onto the sidewalk to avoid hitting another vehicle. In this scenario, who would be considered responsible for the accident?

If we hold the car's manufacturer or the AI system responsible for the accident, then the traditional legal concept of *criminal intent* may not apply. In this case, whether the accident was intentional or unintentional becomes irrelevant because the AI system followed its programming. However, we should hold the car's driver responsible for the accident, even though they were not in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. In that case, the traditional legal concept of *criminal intent* may still be applicable. In this case, the question of whether the driver intended for the accident to occur would need to be considered in determining their criminal responsibility.

Overall, the implications of AI and free will are complex and far-reaching. Whether these machines have free will has significant implications for how we think about these technologies' ethics and social impact. It will be necessary to carefully consider these implications as we continue to develop and use AI and autonomous machines.

### Legal and policy considerations

First, it is essential to consider the potential implications of recognizing AI as having a free will for existing legal frameworks and regulations. For example, if AI is recognized as having free will, it may be necessary to reassess how the law treats AI regarding responsibility and liability. AI is often treated as a tool or extension of the humans who create and control it. Still, if AI is considered free will, holding it accountable for its actions in certain situations may be necessary.

It is essential to consider the potential impact of AI free will on broader social and economic issues. For example, recognizing AI as having a free will could have implications for issues such as employment and the allocation of resources. The next step in artificial intelligence and robotics is to consider the philosophical perspectives of moral responsibility. This will help us to address the needs and challenges of this field (Ashrafian, 2014).

Ashrafian claims that artificial intelligence agents and robots may be granted legal personhood status. The Roman legal system provides a valuable model for the legal group of future artificial intelligence agents and robots. Like the Roman system, a digital peculium could be applied to robots. Additionally, the Romans granted citizenship and rights to individuals based on their status as freeborn and eventually extended these rights to all freeborn men and women in the empire. Similarly, as artificial intelligence agents and robots become more advanced and integrated into human society, they will be granted legal personhood status, with accompanying rights and responsibilities. The "Caracalla approach" of giving rights and obligations based on level may be applicable in this context. Therefore, it is likely that artificial intelligence agents and robots will be granted legal personhood status over time.

### The potential for AI moral agency

A moral agent can make moral judgments and act on them. This raises the question of whether AI, as an autonomous system, could be considered a moral agent. One argument for AI moral agency is that, as AI systems become more advanced, they can make moral judgments comparable to those made by humans. For example, an AI system may be able to analyze a situation and determine the best course of action based on ethical principles, just as a human might. If an AI system can make moral judgments this way, it could be considered a moral agent.

The principle of responsibility requires self-awareness to fulfill the objectives that we assign to it. Therefore, self-awareness is necessary for moral responsibility (Mario Verdicchio, 2022). Verdicchio argues that the attribution of responsibility and the application of sanctions should have communicative, remedial, or strictly restorative purposes. Assigning blame and imposing sanctions should be to communicate, remedy, or restore rather than seek revenge or pure retribution.

The statement suggests that assigning responsibility and applying sanctions for these purposes can help motivate lawful behavior and prevent harmful conduct in society. It also implies that overcoming the prejudice that guilt and responsibility require free will makes it possible to adopt these more constructive and preventative approaches to accountability and punishment.

## **Conclusion**

AI free will is a complex and contentious topic in philosophy. In this paper, we have defended the thesis that advanced AI systems can be considered to have free will and moral agency. We have argued that, as AI systems become more advanced, they will be able to make moral judgments and act on them in a manner comparable to human beings.

### Future research and development of AI

The topic of AI free will is likely to continue to be an important area of research and development in AI. As AI systems become more advanced and integrated into society, it will be necessary to continue to explore the ethical implications of these systems and to consider the potential for AI moral agency. Future research in this area may focus on developing ethical frameworks for AI systems and exploring the potential for AI systems to impact society positively.

### Implications for society and individuals

The potential for AI moral agency has significant implications for both society and individuals. On a societal level, the development of advanced AI systems with moral agency could lead to a more ethical and fair society, as these systems could be used to make decisions based on ethical principles. At the same time, however, the development of AI moral agency could also raise concerns about the potential for these systems to act in ways that are unethical or harmful to society.

On an individual level, the development of AI moral agency could have implications for how individuals interact with these systems. For example, individuals may need to consider the moral consequences of their interactions with AI systems and may need to be prepared to accept the decisions made by these systems. Additionally, the development of AI moral agency may raise questions about the role of individuals in society and about the potential for AI systems to challenge the traditional understanding of moral agency.
